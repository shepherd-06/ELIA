# OLA - ECIU ChatBot

ðŸš€ AI Assistant helps students find jobs, internships, scholarships, and research opportunities tailored to their skills and goals. It provides personalized recommendations, tracks deadlines, and refines suggestions based on preferencesâ€”saving time and boosting career success! ðŸŽ“ðŸ’¼

## How it Works

Ola - The Chatbot has a set of instructions (See: `chatgpt-schema\instructions.md`). It currently uses two fixed datasets

1. eciu_opportunities.json
2. research_opportunities.json

Both files are available to view in `datasets` folder. `eciu_opportunities.json` file contains ECIU opportunities after 11 March, 2025.

Furthermore, it uses a live API deployed in our backend server to fetch active jobs in various websites. In free-version of the API, the number of requests and concurrent requests is limited. The schema structure is available in `chatgpt-schema\instructions.md` file.
